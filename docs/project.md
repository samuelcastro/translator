# Hackathon Project: Interpreter End-to-End Proof-of-Concept

## Problem

Non-english speaking patients are unable to communicate with clinicians who cannot speak the patients' language. Providers are required to hire in-person or virtual interpreters.

## Goals

Build a web-based Language Interpreter agent designed for an in-person visit that can:

- Interpret between the clinician (English-speaking) and the patient (Spanish-speaking), using speech input and output
- Support special inputs such as the patient saying "repeat that", which should repeat the doctor's previous sentence
- At the end of the conversation, provide a summary of the conversation along with these actions if detected during the conversation: schedule followup appointment, send lab order
- Add and use tools to execute the actions (use https://webhook.site/ to simulate calling an action)
- Store the full conversation and the summary in a database

**NOTE:** Utilize AI coding tools to develop the proof-of-concept if possible (Copilot or Cursor or similar)

## Stack

Use the following stack:

- Use OpenAI Realtime API (WebRTC or Websockets) as the core engine for the Interpreter
- ReactJS frontend: Use ReactJS in a principled manner:
  - Use of state management solution (e.g. redux)
  - Use of React routers
  - Design reusable React components
- Node or Python server
- Pick your own database
- Host on GCP/Vercel (or your choice of hosting solution)

## Deliverables

- Document the list of features you chose to build and why: provide product rationale
- Proof-of-concept: A functional prototype that enables communication between English and Spanish
  - A feature complete UI
  - Text-to-speech output for each utterance
  - Display both sides of the conversation in English
  - Display summary of the conversation
  - Store the conversation and the summary in a database
  - Display recognized intents/actions (listed above under Goals) along with their metadata
  - Execute actions using tools (use https://webhook.site/)
- Technical Design Doc that captures your thought process
